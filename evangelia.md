title: Text to Image
image_url: /images/dancingAnimals6.jpg
caption: 'Text to Image AI is technology that converts text to Pictures/Images, using AI algorithms. The AI models are feed with a huge amount of pictures/images with a simple description
in order to be trained on converting text to images. These algorithms even if they can generate AI art, unreal images or funny paradox pictures,
there is a lot of lack of photorealism in most of the results. Of course there are huger and more clever text-to-image generator
but are not free to use.
The photo caption was created with the use of free Internet software "DeepAI", a Text To Image - AI Image Generator
and using "Dancing Animals" as input the input text.'
